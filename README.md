This project represented the last grade for my Object Oriented Projected course. Even though i battled with it day and night, it turned out to be a simple but complex and beautiful project that contains all four of the OOP concepts: encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. I think this project made me realise that i really like C++ and i would further want to experiment with it :>. If you want to reuse my project for your OWN benefit, pls let me know or you'll be indebted for life because you will owe me a ton of bitcoins.
